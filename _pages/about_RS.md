Rachael is a second year in the masters program at the University of Maine’s school of earth and climate sciences. She investigates carbon budget in coastal marshes through quantifying greenhouse gas fluxes from marsh blue carbon reservoir. Her thesis focuses on the benthic exchange of methane and other key greenhouse gasses in tidal marshes using process based modeling. Rachael received her bachelor's of science in marine biology with a concentration on coastal conservation from the University of Maine at Machias. She’s passionate about coastal marsh monitoring, research, and education and hopes to pursue a career following these interests.
